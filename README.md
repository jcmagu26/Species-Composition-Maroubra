## Introduction

The rocky shore of Maroubra Beach is a dynamic environment with varying elevations and habitats influenced by tides.  

This study explores two main questions:  
1Ô∏è‚É£ How does gastropod abundance change with shoreline height?  
2Ô∏è‚É£ Does species composition differ between rockpools and emergent rocky habitats?

## Methods

### Gastropod Abundance

- Data collected across three elevation zones: low, mid, and high (~4‚Äì6m high, 10m long each).  
- Quadrats randomly placed to avoid bias.  
- Three gastropod species sampled separately: **Nerita** (black snail), **Cellana** (limpet), and **Austrocochlea** (zebra snail).  
- Removed outliers and standardized species labels.  
- Built multiple predictor linear models to test effects of elevation and species on abundance.  
- Verified model assumptions (linearity, homoscedasticity, normality, independence, no outliers).

### Species Composition

- Quadrats randomly placed equally in rockpools and emergent habitats.  
- Recorded all species per quadrat.  
- Removed an impossible outlier in red algae coverage (300%).  
- Used PERMANOVA to test for species composition differences between habitats.  
- Used PCA to visualize species composition variation.

## Results

### Gastropod Abundance

- Both elevation and species significantly affect abundance (**p < 0.001**).  
- Mid elevation zones have higher abundance than low or high zones.  
- **Cellana** has the greatest abundance, followed by **Nerita**, then **Austrocochlea**.

### Species Composition

- PERMANOVA shows significant difference in species composition between rockpools and emergent habitats (**p = 0.001**).  
- PCA reveals overlapping but distinct clusters for habitat types.  
- Algae species are mostly linked to rockpools; other species associate with emergent zones.

## Conclusion

Elevation and habitat type both play key roles in shaping gastropod abundance and species composition at Maroubra Beach. Mid-tidal zones support higher gastropod abundance, and rockpools have a distinct species makeup compared to emergent rocky areas.
